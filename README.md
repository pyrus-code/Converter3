# Simple Unit Converter

A simple and user-friendly desktop application for converting units, built with Python and Tkinter. This project is my first solo application, created as a way to learn and practice core programming concepts.



## üìñ Description

This project is a graphical unit converter that allows users to easily switch between kilometers and miles. It was developed as a personal challenge to understand GUI (Graphical User Interface) development, handle user input, and manage application state. The goal was to create a functional, intuitive tool while exploring the capabilities of Python's built-in Tkinter library.

## ‚ú® Features

This converter comes with several user-friendly features:

* **Two-Way Conversion:** Convert from Kilometers to Miles or from Miles to Kilometers.
* **Customizable Precision:** Choose the number of decimal places (1, 2, or 3) for the result.
* **Conversion History:** The application remembers your last 5 conversions, which you can view at any time.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures that only valid numbers are entered for conversion.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and simple GUI with clear buttons and menus for a straightforward experience.

## üöÄ How to Run

This application is built entirely with Python's standard library, so you don't need to install any external packages.

1.  **Make sure you have Python installed** on your system (version 3.x is recommended).
2.  **Clone or download this repository** to your local machine.
3.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal:
